  Sentences:
  - "Wh-what are you looking at?! Is it because I sleep here on the street??!! It
    didn\u2019t used to be like this, I had cash first, lot\u2019s of it, but then
    I got tricked!"
  - 'I got an email saying I won a million dollars and all I had to do was send my
    bank details too them.

    Biggest mistake of my life....'
  - 'I gave them my bank details and a day later I was broke. Those bastards

    withdraw every single penny I had from my account.'
  - "So kid, what I\u2019m trying to say is,  when you get an email like that, don\u2019t
    respond. It\u2019s called PHISING and they send these kind of email to everyone..."
  - and if you send them something back, they got bait.
  - "Don\u2019t ever phish or get phished, don\u2019t make people miserable like me,
    we already live in a depressing world."
  - Now, run off, let me drink in peace!!!
