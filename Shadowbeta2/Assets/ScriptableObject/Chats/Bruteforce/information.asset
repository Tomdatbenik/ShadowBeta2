  Sentences:
  - A few students already failed to guess the password of the terminal at the arcade.
    Therefore I will give you a hint to attack more complex passwords.
  - "When you get to the terminal, you should make a script that guesses passwords,
    don\u2019t worry about typing the code..."
  - because I already arranged a few necessary function that need to be put inside
    a code block. This is called brute forcing...
  - this technique is used to guess passwords automatically. Simple passwords will
    get brute forced easier than complex passwords.
  - 'This is called brute forcing, this technique is used to guess passwords automatically.
    Simple

    passwords will get brute forced easier than complex passwords.'
  - 'A simple password has no special characters and no uppercase letters. For example:
    12345, qwerty, password or safe password.'
  - I hope you will learn something about hacking passwords with the help of brute
    forcing it!
